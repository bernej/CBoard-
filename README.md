THE IMPORTANCE OF SMART KEYBOARDS

What is a smart keyboard? By my definition, it is a keyboard that uses artificial intelligence, computation, and logic to make typing as easy as possible. 
Some people like typing, or more importantly, are good at it. However, if one does not have the physical ability to move oneâ€™s fingers simultaneously, how would one type efficiently on a normal keyboard? 
How would one type efficiently if one can only type with a single finger at a time? That is where this application comes in. 
Much like xkeys, it is a specialized interface to make typing easier for its intended audience; 
that audience being people who do not use a normal keyboard under any circumstances. However, unlike xkeys, this keyboard is specifically tailored to coding.
